# last_letter_2
A ROS+Gazebo UAV Simulator

Simulator for flight models, such as fixed-wing and multirotors. The simulator is called Last letter 2 and is a ROS package combined with Gazebo. The Last letter 2 was created in order to help flight robot researchers build their models, program the control algorithms and preform quick and reliable useful simulations before the experimental tests.

The main part of simulator is written in ROS. The Gazebo helps in visualizing the results of simulation and in solving the model kinematics thanks to its physics machine. That makes Last letter 2 an almost complete and autonomous system that can work with many other robotic simulations, not only Gazebo.
